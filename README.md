# About me
Hi, im Adam Wudarczyk. It is nice to have you here!

A few years ago I sat down at the computer, curious, what is it like with this programming? 
That's how I started learning Python. Later I was wondering "what are these databases?" and I started learning SQL. 
"And what is it like to make a website?" I wondered. Html, css, JavaScript, came to help me.
And so I went through a few more languages to finally get to software testing.
So why testing?
Because I'm curious to find bugs. I am courius "what and why doesn't work?".
And I find it interesting to help solve problems.

Below are my experience and the things I have done/learned/read to develop my testing skills.
